## Inspiration
Our inspiration for ByteSecure stems from the urgent need to enhance financial inclusion globally, particularly for those who are unbanked or underbanked. Traditional payment methods, such as credit and debit cards, are not accessible to a significant portion of the global population. According to the World Bank, approximately 1.5 billion people are unbanked, with high concentrations in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa, where over 40% of the population lacks access to formal financial services. In countries with unstable regulatory authorities, government-issued currencies can experience significant inflation, further destabilizing their economies.

We define "unbanked" individuals as those who have access to technology but live in countries with weak financial institutions that do not provide traditional banking services like credit or debit cards. Examples of such countries include:

Nigeria: Despite having a growing tech sector, many Nigerians lack access to formal banking services and credit cards.
Philippines: While mobile phone usage is widespread, a significant portion of the population remains unbanked, lacking access to credit and debit card facilities.
Myanmar: Economic instability and limited banking infrastructure result in a large unbanked population.
Bangladesh: Many people in rural areas have limited access to formal banking services and credit cards.
Venezuela: Ongoing economic challenges and hyperinflation make traditional banking services inaccessible to many.
ByteSecure aims to address these gaps by providing a blockchain-powered payment system that does not rely on traditional banking infrastructure. By leveraging blockchain technology, ByteSecure offers a secure and decentralized solution for financial transactions, ensuring users retain full control over their funds. This concept has been validated in real-world contexts, such as United Nations refugee camps, where blockchain has been used to provide financial services to displaced populations.

The recent integration of Solana Pay with Shopify has demonstrated the viability of incorporating blockchain payment solutions into e-commerce platforms. Inspired by these successes, ByteSecure seeks to empower users in underserved areas with a decentralized platform that offers financial autonomy and security. Our goal is to unlock a modern way of living for these individuals, providing them access to a wide variety of financial products and services.
